Module 2 homework

Hello, this project was created by Kim for the module 2 VBA challenge. It contains six files.

Three files containing the code:
1. VBA Challenge - Part 1 - an output that contains the ticker symbol, yearly change, percent change and total stock volume.  As well as conditional formatting to highlight positive and negative changes.
2. VBA Challenge - Bonus - Part 1 - includes an additional summary table displaying the greatest % increase and decrease as well as the greatest total volume.
3. VBA Challenge - Bonus - Part 2 - ensures the VBA script runs on all sheets

As well as three additional files containing screen shots (one for each year 2018, 2019, and 2020), showing the excel sheets once the code has been run.

Thanks!
Kim
